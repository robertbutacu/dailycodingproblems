/*
There's a staircase with N steps, and you can climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase.
The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X?
For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time. Generalize your function to take in X.
